## 第四十六節

WHEN did people begin to abandon the worship of idols, unless it were since the very Word of God came among men? When have oracles ceased and become void of meaning, among the Greeks and everywhere, except since the Saviour has revealed Himself on earth?
人々が偶像崇拝をやめ始めたのは、神のことばなる方が人のあいだに来られてからでないとしたら、いったいいつからなのか。ギリシャ人の間だけでなくいたるところで神託がやめられ、意味を失ったのは、救い主がご自分を地上に現されてからでないとしたら、いったいいつからなのか。
When did those whom the poets call gods and heroes begin to be adjudged as mere mortals, except when the Lord took the spoils of death and preserved incorruptible the body He had taken, raising it from among the dead?
詩人が神々や英雄と呼んだ者たちがただの死すべきものであると見なされ始めたのは、主が死を無力化し、主のまとった肉体が不死を保ち、死者の中から肉体をよみがえらせたときでないとしたら、いったいいつからなのか。
Or when did the deceitfulness and madness of daemons fall under contempt, save when the Word, the Power of God, the Master of all these as well, condescended on account of the weakness of mankind and appeared on earth? When did the practice and theory of magic begin to be spurned under foot, if not at the manifestation of the Divine Word to men?
あるいは、悪霊の詐欺と狂気が軽蔑にも値しないほど落ちたのは、みことばなる方、神の力、悪霊どもに対しても主人である方が、人類の弱さを思い遣ってへりくだり、地上に現れたときでないとしたら、いったいいつなのか。魔術の理論と実践が足の下に踏みにじられ始めたのは、神のことばが人に顕現したときでないとしたら、いったいいつなのか。
In a word, when did the wisdom of the Greeks become foolish, save when the true Wisdom of God revealed Himself on earth? In old times the whole world . and every place in it was led astray by the worship of idols, and men thought the idols were the only gods that were.
一言で言えば、ギリシャ人の知恵が愚かになったのは、真実な神の知恵がご自分を地上に現されたときでないとしたら、いったいいつなのか。古い時代には、全世界いたるところで偶像崇拝がはびこり、ただ偶像だけが実在する神々であると考えられていた。
But now all over the world men are forsaking the fear of idols and taking refuge with Christ; and by worshipping Him as God they come through Him to know the Father also, Whom formerly they did not know. The amazing thing, moreover, is this.
けれども今は、世界中の人々が偶像への畏畏敬を捨て、キリストに慰めを見出しつつある。キリストを神と崇めることによって、キリストを通じて、人々は以前知らなかった御父をも知るようになった。もっと驚くべきことがある。
The objects of worship formerly were varied and countless ; each place had its own idol and the so-called god of one place could not pass over to another in order to persuade the people there to worship him, but was barely reverenced even by his own. Indeed no ! Nobody worshipped his neighbour's god, but every man had his own idol and thought that it was lord of all.
以前は礼拝対象は多種多様なものが無数にあった。場所ごとに異なる偶像があり、しかもひとつの地域の神と呼ばれるものは、他の地域の神を見過ごすことができず、他の地域の人々を信じさせようと説得するものの、成功することはほとんどないといったありさまだった。どだい無理なことだった！　隣人の神を拝む者はいなかったし、おのおのが自分の偶像を、これこそが万物の主であると考えていた。
But now Christ alone is worshipped, as One and the Same among all peoples everywhere; and what the feebleness of idols could not do, namely, convince even those dwelling close at hand, He has effected. He has persuaded not only those close at hand, but literally the entire world to worship one and the same Lord and through Him the Father.
しかし、今は、ただキリストおひとりが地域によらずあらゆる民族にとって唯一の同じ方として崇められている。しかも貧弱な偶像にはできなかったこと、すなわち、近隣地域に住む人々をも信じさせるということが、この方の影響力では可能であった。この方が信じさせたのは近隣地域だけではない。文字通り全世界で、この方はひとりの同じ主として崇められ、またこの方を通じて御父が崇められている。

## 第四十七節

Again, in former times every place was full of the fraud of the oracles, and the utterances of those at Delphi and Dordona and in Boeotia and Lycia and Libya and Egypt and those of the Kabiri and the Pythoness were considered marvellous by the minds of men. But now, since Christ has been proclaimed everywhere, their madness too has ceased, and there is no one left among them to give oracles at all.
また、以前はどこに行っても偽物の神託がそこら中にあった。デルフォイやドードーナなどの神託所や、ボイオーティア、リュキア、リビア、エジプトでの託宣や、カビリの秘儀やピューティアーの神託。そういうものが人の心をとらえ、驚嘆すべきものと考えられていた。しかし今は、あらゆるところにキリストが宣べ伝えられたので、神託への熱狂はすたれ、誰も神託をしなくなった。
Then, too, daemons used to deceive men's minds by taking up their abode in springs or rivers or trees or stones and imposing upon simple people by their frauds. But now, since. the Divine appearing of the Word, all this fantasy has ceased, for by the sign of the cross, if a man will but use it, he drives out their deceits.
また以前は、悪霊どもが人の心を惑わそうと、泉や川や木々や石に住みつき、騙されやすい人々をもてあそんでいた。しかし今は、みことばなる方が神を現したので、そのような空想事はすっかりやんだ。十字架のしるしが現れたので、それさえ使えば悪霊どもの欺きを見破れるようになったからである。
Again, people used to regard as gods those who are mentioned in the poets-Zeus and Kronos and Apollo and the heroes, and in worshipping them they went astray. But now that the Saviour has appeared among men, those others have been exposed as mortal men, and Christ alone is recognised as true God, Word of God, God Himself.
繰り返そう。以前は、数々の詩で称えられているゼウス、クロノス、アポロなどの英雄が神々と見なされていたし、人々は彼らを崇めて堕落していった。しかし今は、救い主が人のあいだに現れ、神々と見なされた者がじつは死すべき人間にすぎなかったという事実が暴かれ、キリストおひとりが真の神、神のことば、神ご自身であると認められている。
And what is one to say about the magic that they think so marvellous? Before the sojourn of the Word, it was strong and active among Egyptians and Chaldaeans and Indians and filled all who saw it with terror and astonishment. But by the coming of the Truth and the manifestation of the Word it too has been confuted and entirely destroyed.
では人々が驚嘆の念で見上げていた魔術については何が言えるだろうか。みことばなる方が来られる前は、エジプト人やカルデア人やインド人のあいだで魔術は盛んに行なわれ、強勢を誇っていたた。魔術は見る者に非常な恐怖と畏敬を与えていた。けれども、真理なる方が来、みことばなる方が顕現すると、魔術もまた論駁され、完全に滅ぼされた。
As to Greek wisdom, however, and the philosophers' noisy talk, I really think no one requires argument from us; for the amazing fact is patent to all that, for all that they had written so much, the Greeks failed to convince even a few from their own neighbourhood in regard to immortality and the virtuous ordering of life. Christ alone, using common speech and through the agency of men not clever with their tongues, has convinced whole assemblies of people all the world over to despise death, and to take heed to the things that do not die, to look past the things of time and gaze on things eternal, to think nothing of earthly glory and to aspire only to immortality.
しかしながら、ギリシャ人の知恵や、哲学者の無駄話についてはどうだろうか。議論するまでもないと私は確信している。というのも、誰の目にも明白なとおり、ギリシャ人の哲学者が書き残したすべての本をもってしても、不死のいのちと徳ある生き方について、近隣地域のほんの数人さえも説得できなかったからである。キリストおひとりが、雄弁とは言いがたい人々の口を通じて、平易な言葉で、世界中の老若男女を説き伏せたのである。死を軽蔑すること、死なないものに注意を払うこと、一時的なものではなく永遠のものから目を離さないこと、地上の栄光を思わず不死なるものだけを待ち望むことを。

// § 48
## 第四十八節

These things which we have said are no mere words they are attested by actual experience. Anyone who likes may see the proof of glory in the virgins of Christ, and in the young men who practise chastity as part of their religion, and in the assurance of immortality in so great and glad a company of martyrs. (Literally, "so great a chorus ...", xopos ; being properly a band of dancers and singers.) Anyone, too, may put what we have said to the proof of experience in another way. In the very presence of the fraud of daemons and the imposture of the oracles and the wonders of magic, let him use the sign of the cross which they all mock at, and but speak the Name of Christ, and he shall see how through Him daemons are routed, oracles cease, and all magic and witchcraft is confounded.
私たちがここまで述べてきたことは、言葉による証明だけでなくじっさいの経験によっても証明できる。お望みならば、栄えある証明をどうぞご覧あれ。キリストの処女たち、宗教的動機で貞潔を守る若者、殉教者の偉大さと歓喜（文字通りには歌と踊りの「偉大な合唱 xopos」）に見られる不死の保証がその証明である。また他にも、私たちが述べたことに対する経験的な証明がある。悪霊の欺きや神託の詐欺や魔術の惑わしのまさに目の前で、異邦人がみな嘲笑っている十字架のしるしを使ってみよ。キリストの御名を語ってみよ。そうすれば、キリストによって悪霊どもが逃げ出し、神託がやみ、魔術と魔法がうろたえるのを見るだろう。

Who, then, is this Christ and how great is He, Who by His Name and presence overshadows and confounds all things on every side, Who alone is strong against all and has filled the whole world with His teaching? Let the Greeks tell us, who mock at Him without stint or shame. If He is a man, how is it that one man has proved stronger than all those whom they themselves regard as gods, and by His own power has shown them to be nothing?
では、このキリストというお方はいったいどなたなのか。その御名と臨在によって万物がうろたえて鳴りを潜めるほどのお方、ただひとり万物にまさって強く、全世界にその御教えを広げたこのお方は、どれほど偉大なのか。恥も外聞もなくキリストを笑っているギリシャ人に答えさせてみよ。。もしこの方がただの人間であるというなら、ギリシャ人が神々とみなす者たちよりもたったひとりの人のほうが強いことをご自分で証明し、その英雄たちが無に等しい者であることをご自分の力で示したのはいったいどういうことなのか。
If they call Him a magician, how is it that by a magician all magic is destroyed, instead of being rendered strong? Had He conquered certain magicians or proved Himself superior to one of them only, they might reasonably think that He excelled the rest only by His greater skill. But the fact is that His cross has vanquished all magic entirely and has conquered the very name of it. Obviously, therefore, the Saviour is no magician, for the very daemons whom the magicians invoke flee from Him as from their Master. Who is He, then?
もしこの方が魔術師であるというなら、ひとりの魔術師によってあらゆる魔術が興隆するどころか滅ぼされるのはいったいどういうことなのか。数人の魔術師を征服したり、魔術師の中のひとりよりもまさっていることを示しただけであれば、この方が卓越した魔術のスキルだけで残りの者に勝ったと考えるのは合理的といえよう。だが、事実はこうである。この方の十字架が、すべての魔術を完全に打ち破り、その名前を征服したのだ。それゆえ、明らかに、救い主は魔術師ではない。魔術師たちが加護を求めている悪霊どもこそが、主人であるこの方から逃げ出しているからである。それなら、この方はどなたなのか。
Let the Greeks tell us, whose only serious pursuit is mockery! Perhaps they will say that He, too, is a daemon, and that is why He prevailed. But even so the laugh is still on our side, for we can confute them by the same proofs as before. How could He be a daemon, Who drives daemons out? If it were only certain ones that He drove out, then they might reasonably think that He prevailed against them through the power of their Chief, as the Jews, wishing to insult Him, actually said. But since the fact is, here again, that at the mere naming of His Name all madness of the daemons is rooted out and put to flight, obviously the Greeks are wrong here, too, and our Lord and Saviour Christ is not, as they maintain, some daemonic power.
冷笑ばかりを熱心に追い求めているギリシャ人に答えさせてみよ！　もしかするとこう言うかもしれない。彼も悪霊であり、だからこそ悪霊どもに勝利したのだ、と。だが、今度は私たちが笑う番だ。先ほどと同じ証明で彼らを反駁できるのだから。悪霊どもを追い出すこの方がどうして悪霊でありうるのか。この方が追い出したのがただ一部の悪霊だけであれば、この方が悪霊どもに勝利したのが悪霊のかしらの力によると考えるのも合理的といえよう。じっさいユダヤ人がこの方を侮辱してそう言ったように。だが、事実はまたしてもこうである。この方の御名によって、ただの名前によって、狂気の悪霊どもがすべて根絶やしにされ、追い散らされている。この点でも明らかにギリシャ人は間違っている。私たちの主であり救い主であるキリストは、ギリシャ人が主張するような悪魔的な力ではない。

If, then, the Saviour is neither a mere man nor a magician, nor one of the daemons, but has by His Godhead confounded and overshadowed the opinions of the poets and the delusion of the daemons and the wisdom of the Greeks, it must be manifest and will be owned by all that He is in truth Son of God, Existent Word and Wisdom and Power of the Father. This is the reason why His works are no mere human works, but, both intrinsically and by comparison with those of men, are recognised as being superhuman and truly the works of God.
それでは、救い主がただの人間でもなく、魔術師でもなく、悪霊どものひとりでもなく、むしろその神性によって詩人の意見も悪霊の欺きもギリシャ人の知恵もうろたえて鳴りを潜めたとしたら、この方こそが本当に神の御子であり、御父の存在することば、知恵、力であるということがすべての人に明白とならなければならないし、所有されるだろう。このようなわけで、この方の働きはただの人間の働きではなく、むしろ、本質的に、人との比較によっても、人間を超えた存在であり、真に神の御業であると認識されるのである。

§ 49

What man that ever was, for instance, formed a body for himself from a virgin only? Or what man ever healed so many diseases as the common Lord of all? Who restored that which was lacking in man's nature or made one blind from birth to see? Aesculapius was deified by the Greeks because he practised the art of healing and discovered herbs as remedies for bodily diseases, not, of course, forming them himself out of the earth, but finding them out by the study of nature. But what is that in comparison with what the Saviour did when, instead of just healing a wound, He both fashioned essential being and restored to health the thing that He had formed? Hercules, too, is worshipped as a god by the Greeks because he fought against other men and destroyed wild animals by craft. But what is that to what the Word did, in driving away from men diseases and daemons and even death itself? Dionysus is worshipped among them, because he taught men drunkenness; yet they ridicule the true Saviour and Lord of all, Who taught men temperance.

That, however, is enough on this point. What will they say to the other marvels of His Godhead? At what man's death was the sun darkened and the earth shaken? Why, even to this day men are dying, and they did so also before that time. When did any such marvels happen in their case? Now shall we pass over the deeds done in His earthly body and mention those after His resurrection? Has any man's teaching, in any place or at any time, ever prevailed everywhere as one and the same, from one end of the earth to the other, so that his worship has fairly flown through every land? Again, if, as they say, Christ is man only and not God the Word, why do not the gods of the Greeks prevent His entering their domains? Or why, on the other hand, does the Word Himself dwelling in our midst make an end of their worship by His teaching and put their fraud to shame?

§ 50

Many before Him have been kings and tyrants of the earth, history tells also of many among the Chaldaeans and Egyptians and Indians who were wise men and magicians. But which of those, I do not say after his death, but while yet in this life, was ever able so far to prevail as to fill the whole world with his teaching and retrieve so great a multitude from the craven fear of idols, as our Saviour has won over from idols to Himself? The Greek philosophers have compiled many works with persuasiveness and much skill in words ; but what fruit have they to show for this such as has the cross of Christ? Their wise thoughts were persuasive enough until they died ; yet even in their life-time their seeming influence was counterbalanced by their rivalry with one another, for they were a jealous company and declaimed against each other. But the Word of God, by strangest paradox, teaching in meaner language, has put the choicest sophists in the shade, and by confounding their teachings and drawing all men to Himself He has filled His own assemblies. Moreover, and this is the marvellous thing, by going down as Man to death He has confounded all the sounding Utterances of the wise men about the idols. For whose death ever drove out daemons, or whose death did ever daemons fear, save that of Christ? For where the Saviour is named, there every daemon is driven out. Again, who has ever so rid men of their natural passions that fornicators become chaste and murderers no longer wield the sword and those who formerly were craven cowards boldly play the man? In a word, what persuaded the barbarians and heathen folk in every place to drop their madness and give heed to peace, save the faith of Christ and the sign of the cross? What other things have given men such certain faith in immortality as have the cross of Christ and the resurrection of His body? The Greeks told all sorts of false tales, but they could never pretend that their idols rose again from death : indeed it never entered their heads that a body could exist again after death at all. And one would be particularly ready to listen to them on this point, because by these opinions they have exposed the weakness of their own idolatry, at the same time yielding to Christ the possibility of bodily resurrection, so that by that means He might be recognised by all as Son of God.

§ 51

Again, who among men, either after his death or while yet living, taught about virginity and did not account this virtue impossible for human beings? But Christ our Saviour and King of all has so prevailed with His teaching on this subject that even children not yet of lawful age promise that virginity which transcends the law. And who among men has ever been able to penetrate even to Scythians and Ethiopians, or Parthians or Armenians or those who are said to live beyond Hyrcania, or even the Egyptians and Chaldaeans, people who give heed to magic and are more than naturally enslaved by the fear of daemons and savage in their habits, and to preach at all, about virtue and self-control and against the worshipping of idols, as has the Lord of all, the Power of God, our Lord Jesus Christ? Yet He not only preached through His own disciples, but also wrought so persuasively on men's understanding that, laying aside their savage habits and forsaking the worship of their ancestral gods, they learnt to know Him and through Him to worship the Father. While they were yet idolaters, the Greeks and Barbarians were always at war with each other, and were even cruel to their own kith and kin. Nobody could travel by land or sea at all unless he was armed with swords, because of their irreconcilable quarrels with each other. Indeed, the whole course of their life was carried on with the weapons, and the sword with them replaced the staff and was the mainstay of all aid. All this time, as I said before, they were serving idols and offering sacrifices to daemons, and for all the superstitious awe that accompanied this idol worship, nothing could wean them from that warlike spirit. But, strange to relate, since they came over to the school of Christ, as men moved with real compunction they have laid aside their murderous cruelty and are war-minded no more. On the contrary, all is peace among them and nothing remains save desire for friendship.

§ 52

Who, then, is He Who has done these things and has united in peace those who hated each other, save the beloved Son of the Father, the common Saviour of all, Jesus Christ, Who by His own love underwent all things for our salvation? Even from the beginning, moreover, this peace that He was to administer was foretold, for Scripture says, "They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into sickles, and nation shall not take sword against nation, neither shall they learn any more to wage war." (Isaiah 2. 4) Nor is this by any means incredible. The barbarians of the present day are naturally savage in their habits, and as long, as they sacrifice to their idols they rage furiously against each other and cannot bear to be a single hour without weapons. But when they hear the teaching of Christ, forthwith they turn from fighting to farming, and instead of arming themselves with swords extend their hands in prayer. In a word, instead of fighting each other, they take up arms against the devil and the daemons, and overcome them by their selfcommand and integrity of soul. These facts are proof of the Godhead of the Saviour, for He has taught men what they could never learn among the idols. It is also no small exposure of the weakness and nothingness of daemons and idols, for it was because they knew their own weakness that the daemons were always setting men to fight each other, fearing lest, if they ceased from mutual strife, they would turn to attack the daemons themselves. For in truth the disciples of Christ, instead of fighting each other, stand arrayed against daemons by their habits and virtuous actions, and chase them away and mock at their captain the devil. Even in youth they are chaste, they endure in times of testing and persevere ins toils. When they are insulted, they are patient, when robbed they make light of it, and, marvellous to relate, they make light even of death itself, and become martyrs of Christ.

§ 53

And here is another proof of the Godhead of the Saviour, which is indeed utterly amazing. What mere man or magician or tyrant or king was ever able by himself to do so much? Did anyone ever fight against the whole system of idol-worship and the whole host of daemons and all magic and all the wisdom of the Greeks, at a time when all of these were strong and flourishing and taking everybody in, as did our Lord, the very Word of God? Yet He is even now invisibly exposing every man's error, and single-handed is carrying off all men from them all, so that those who used to worship idols now tread them under foot, reputed magicians burn their books and the wise prefer to all studies the interpretation of the gospels. They are deserting those whom formerly they worshipped, they worship and confess as Christ and God Him Whom they used to ridicule as crucified. Their so-called gods are routed by the sign of the cross, and the crucified Saviour is proclaimed in all the world as God and Son of God. Moreover, the gods worshipped among the Greeks are now falling into disrepute among them on account of the disgraceful things they did, for those who receive the teaching of Christ are more chaste in life than they. If these, and the like of them, are human works, let anyone who will show us similar ones done by men in former time, and so convince us. But if they are shown to be, and are the works not of men but of God, why are the unbelievers so irreligious as not to recognise the Master Who did them? They are afflicted as a man would be who failed to recognise God the Artificer through the works of creation. For surely if they had recognised His Godhead through His power over the universe, they would recognise also that the bodily works of Christ are not human, but are those of the Saviour of all, the Word of God. And had they recognised this, as Paul says, "They would not have crucified the Lord of glory. " (1 Cor. 2. 8)

§ 54

As, then, he who desires to see God Who by nature is invisible and not to be beheld, may yet perceive and know Him through His works, so too let him who does not see Christ with his understanding at least consider Him in His bodily works and test whether they be of man or God. If they be of man, then let him scoff; but if they -be of God, let him not mock at things which are no fit subject for scorn, but rather let him recognise the fact and marvel that things divine have been revealed to us by such humble means, that through death deathlessness has been made known to us, and through the Incarnation of the Word the Mind whence all things proceed has been declared, and its Agent and Ordainer, the Word of God Himself. He, indeed, assumed humanity that we might become God. He manifested Himself by means of a body in order that we might perceive the Mind of the unseen Father. He endured shame from men that we might inherit immortality. He Himself was unhurt by this, for He is impassible and incorruptible ; but by His own impassibility He kept and healed the suffering men on whose account He thus endured. In short, such and so many are the Saviour's achievements that follow from His Incarnation, that to try to number them is like gazing at the open sea and trying to count the waves. One cannot see all the waves with one's eyes, for when one tries to do so those that are following on baffle one's senses. Even so, when one wants to take in all the achievements of Christ in the body, one cannot do so, even by reckoning them up, for the things that transcend one's thought are always more than those one thinks that one has grasped.

As we cannot speak adequately about even a part of His work, therefore, it will be better for us not to speak about it as a whole. So we will mention but one thing more, and then leave the whole for you to marvel at. For, indeed, everything about it- is marvellous, and wherever a man turns his gaze he sees the Godhead of the Word and is smitten with awe.

§ 55

The substance of what we have said so far may be summarised as follows. Since the Saviour came to dwell among us, not only does idolatry no longer increase, but it is getting less and gradually ceasing to be. Similarly,not only does the wisdom of the Greeks no longer make any progress, but that which used to be is disappearing. And daemons, so far from continuing to impose on people by their deceits and oracle-givings and sorceries, are routed by the sign of the cross if they so much as try. On the other hand, while idolatry and everything else that opposes the faith of Christ is daily dwindling and weakening and falling, see, the Saviour's teaching is increasing everywhere! Worship, then, the Saviour " Who is above all" and mighty, even God the Word, and condemn those who are being defeated and made to disappear by Him. When the sun has come, darkness prevails no longer; any of it that may be left anywhere is driven away. So also, now that the Divine epiphany of the Word of God has taken place, the darkness of idols prevails no more, and all parts of the world in every direction are enlightened by His teaching. Similarly, if a king be reigning somewhere, but stays in his own house and does not let himself be seen, it often happens that some insubordinate fellows, taking advantage of his retirement, will have themselves proclaimed in his stead ; and each of them, being invested with the semblance of kingship, misleads the simple who, because they cannot enter the palace and see the real king, are led astray by just hearing a king named. When the real king emerges, however, and appears to view, things stand differently. The insubordinate impostors are shown up by his presence, and men, seeing the real king, forsake those who previously misled them. In the same way the daemons used formerly to impose on. men, investing themselves with the honour due to God. But since the Word of God has been manifested in a body, and has made known to us His own Father, the fraud of the daemons is stopped and made to disappear and men, turning their eyes to the true God, Word of the Father, forsake the idols and come to know the true God.

Now this is proof that Christ is God, the Word and Power of God. For whereas human things cease and the fact of Christ remains, it is clear to all that the things which cease are temporary, but that He Who remains is God and very Son of God, the sole-begotten Word.
